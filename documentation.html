<!-- SUMMARY LIST -->
<p>Summary:
<ul>
	<li>My website was created using the HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages</li>
	<li>I used the 'Atom' editor to do the code, as this editor can work with all three languages</li>
	<li>I used W3 Schools for help as well as the modules and labs covered in class</li>
	<li>I sourced royalty free images from Pixabay</li>
	<li>I sourced the audio from my company, and the video from my company's YouTube page</li>
</ul>
</p>

<br>

<!-- ACCESSIBILITY LIST -->
<p>Accessibility:
<ul>
	<li>I created the dropdown navigation for easy accessibility of each page</li>
	<li>The logo at the top left can be clicked at any time to go back to the homepage (index)</li>
	<li>The form in my 'Contact' page is very clear and easy to use</li>
	<li>I changed the layout slightly from how I'd originally planned to display the website.
    I made the content narrower and in the centre, to ensure that when the display settings are scaled down, the webpages are still readable and look good.</li>
	<li>The website is best viewed on a widescreen display at 100% in the browser.
    However, if a narrower screen is used, zooming out on the browser to roughly 50% or 70% will display the webpages in full.</li>
  <li>The font sizes are big enough for everyone to read.</li>
  <li>The text colour contrasts against the background of all pages, making it very clear and easy to understand.</li>
	<li>The homepage has a 'Discover' button which takes the user to the 'About' page. I was inspired by other websites that have similar features on their homepages.
		This allows the user to jump straight into the information with the click of a button.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<br>

<!-- SECURITY LIST -->
<p>Security:
<ul>
	<li>One thing to take into consideration is form submissions. Although my form does not export data to a server or database, if I were to set it up this way I would ensure to encrypt the data.
		This would be done by submitting the data via https rather than http. That way, the "e_design" orgranisation would be able to protect its customers' information.</li>
	<li>To have a secure website, you need to protect against malicious code. Hackers can inject mailicious JavaScript into websites, so things need to be put in place to stop it.
		There are tools which can be implemented to enforce what code is allowed to run on your page, such as Content Security Policy (CSP).</li>
	<li>I have implemented form validation, which means only certain strings of text can be inserted. Hackers can inject malicious code into databases by entering text into forms.
		By ensuring you control the type of data that is entered, you can stop malicious code being sent to your database or server.</li>
</ul>
